# Modern Javascript and Its Tooling
 
Alfred Ayache, former president of TDUG, will give a brief recap of his developer’s journey since Delphi, and explore his current tools and workflow. 
 
He’ll cover:
  - basic Javascript and its environments, 
  - ES6, 
  - Node and npm, 
  - Babel, 
  - ESLint,
  - Prettier,
  - VS Code,
  - the major modern frameworks (Angular, React, Vue), 
  - task runners (Grunt, Gulp, Webpack),
  - and demonstrate Create React App (a CRA you can love),
  - resources, free and otherwise, to help you come up to speed (or “level up” as the kids call it nowadays).

Expect ribald tales of developer excesses from a crusty curmudgeon who’s seen it all, and done most of it.
 
Everyone will go home with a FREE, unlimited copy of ES6.
