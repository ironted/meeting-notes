# Using Materials in FireMonkey 3D

This is a follow-up to our Introduction to FireMonlkey 3D meeting in June where we talked about how to create and manipulate 3D objects.

This month weâ€™ll dig a little deeper into the internals of 3D objects and how to use materials/textures to add colour, shadows and images. FireMonkey does a lot of the heavy lifting for us, but you can do some interesting things with a little understanding of how things work under the hood.
