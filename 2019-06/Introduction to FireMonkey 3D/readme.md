# Introduction to FireMonkey 3D

FireMonkey is Embarcadero's cross-platform UI framework. On top of the regular UI elements you would expect, it also includes some interesting hardware accelerated graphics features, and built-in 3D functionality.

We will demonstrate how to create 3D applications, combine 2D and 3D elements in the UI and how to create and use 3D objects.
