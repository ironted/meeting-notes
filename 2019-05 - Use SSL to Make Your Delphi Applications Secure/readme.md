# Use SSL to make your Delphi applications secure. For free.

Delphi is so well known for building desktop applications and for its database functionality that it might be easy to overlook its long history of server and multi-tier support. Everything from simple networking components to MIDAS/DataSnap to web applications to XML web services to RAD Server and more.

But now, with all of this network traffic, security becomes an issue. How do you keep your sensitive information safe from prying eyes? Unfortunately, proper security can be difficult, time consuming and expensive

But it doesn’t have to be.

We’ll use the Delphi Community Edition to create some server applications and other free tools like OpenSSL and Let’s Encrypt to let us talk to them securely.
