# Fractals!

I admit, it’s a pretty broad topic. Since fractals stopped being exclusively the domain of mathematicians and entered into popular culture, people have waxed poetic about how they mirror the chaotic nature the universe and might have implications in string theory and spiritual enlightenment and so on…

We’re not going to get too philosophical, but we will talk about some common fractals and why they’re interesting and demonstrate how to recreate them using Delphi and FireMonkey. We’re going to make pretty pictures!

Warning: There will be some math (maths?). Nothing too intimidating, though. Honestly, if I can understand it, then how hard can it be?
