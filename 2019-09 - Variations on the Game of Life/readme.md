# Variations on the Game of Life

I'd be surprised if anyone hasn't at least heard about The game of Life; A simulation that began as a thought experiment in 1940 and was made popular by John Conway in 1970.

But what does it all mean?

I don't know how philosophical we'll get, but we will look at the theory behind cellular automata and how it changed the way we think about simulating complex systems using simlpe rules. Then we'll look at our own implementations of Wolfram's elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life using Delphi and FireMonkey.
